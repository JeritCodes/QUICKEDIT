# QuickEdit üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: QuickEdit


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Jerit Reji - Saintgits College Of Engineering
  
### Project Description
The app helps you ‚Äúprocrastinate mindfully.‚Äù Whenever the user starts typing quickly, it encourages them to slow down and type more mindfully,

But it also tracks how well they're procrastinating, giving achievement points for extended periods of idleness.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Introducing a text editor that addresses the non-issue of "too much simplicity" 

by offering unnecessary features that complicate the user experience‚Äîbecause why should editing text be straightforward?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing QuickEdit: a text editor that encourages you to take a break and enjoy the art of distraction.

With quirky features designed to make procrastination enjoyable,

it helps you embrace those moments while still keeping your thoughts organized.
